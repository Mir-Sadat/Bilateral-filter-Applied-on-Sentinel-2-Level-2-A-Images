The bilateral filter is an advanced edge-preserving and noise-reducing filter that combines both spatial and intensity information to smooth images without blurring important edges. Unlike basic filters that only consider pixel proximity, the bilateral filter also takes into account the difference in pixel intensity. It assigns higher weights to nearby pixels that are similar in value, allowing it to reduce noise while preserving sharp edges. This makes it particularly useful in applications like denoising natural images or satellite imagery. When applied to multiband TIFF images, each band is filtered separately, maintaining the spectral integrity of the data. The bilateral filter is especially beneficial when preserving boundaries and details is critical, such as in classification or segmentation tasks.
